 * A class called circle is designed as shown in the following class diagram. It contains:
 * 
 * 1) Two private instance variables: radius (of type double) and color (of type String),
 *    with default value of 1.0 and "red", respectively.
 * 2) Two overloaded constructors;
 * 3) Two public methods: getRadius() and getArea().
 * 
 * The source codes for Circle is as follows:
